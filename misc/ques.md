#how much virtual memory can a process use ?

how many bits does a virtual address have ? (in a 32 bits system)

how CPU generate logical address ????
how linker and loader do ?

#if page table entry is 4 bytes big, then the virtual memory space is no more than 4G ?

#can virtual memory space bigger than physical one ?

virtual memory is a technology, when you ask whether it is finite, it is hard to answer,
cause to judge a technology finite or not is really a philosophy question.

how to implement virtual memory, what does page table do, 32 bits system, 
how CPU generate logical address ???????????


yeah, how CPU generate logical address.
if 32 bits, multilevel page table.
